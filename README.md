# generate-jokes
This repository will host my work on generating jokes using the r/jokes corpus. It is a follow up to my capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. The ultimate goal is to deploy it as either a bot or on a personal website. Due to the nature of the domain, one should be prepared for vulgarity. For a live demo, you can use http://www.beck-macneil.ca/generate-joke to generate jokes on the fly.
